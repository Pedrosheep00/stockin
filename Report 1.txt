At first - starte with the design, 
design for the main page, i figma 
items like profile picture, logo, title of the page, list with homepage link
header done 

main component of the main page, design reduced to a table, with the items to be done
each item with a picture, a name and a number rrepresenting the ammount 

for the footer just the basic copyrighting model

Colors decided as well, from different tons of green, listed in figma 

buttons added on the left and right side of the table, that will lead to the next or previous page.

most of the code generated by myself with the help of the AI chat gpt to organize and reorganize some simple tasks as:
- div organization
- simple errors of mispelling
- creating a loop to store te items, and to create new items in js 
- organize position and orientation of the DIVS created to give the page a layout (HTML) and a design (CSS)

app created in react, from the command promp 
npx create-react-app 

For this step the page is working and ready for the next steps, still needs a bit of details to be adjusted, and the space to add the logo 
after that now,:
 - aiming to connect it to a database, and to start pulling images from the database to the webpage
 - to create a way off letting the user add the new item as the picture of the item, and add a name to it 
 - transform the numbers that are being displayed in each item to an editable number, by the user 
 - adjust the webpage to a form that if more than 10 items are added to go to a new page where more items would be located
 - add Categories button, divide items into categories and allow user to create, delete, rename categories
