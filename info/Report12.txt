----------------------------THINK ABOUT THIS----------------------------------
// FINDING OUT THAT MAYBE, INSTEAD OF CREATING A MAIN PAGE WITH ALL OF THE CARDS, AND PULLING IT ALL FROM THEM, MAYBE
// I SHOULD'VE CREATED A CARD COMPONENT TO FETCH THE CARD DESIGN AND INFORMATION FROM IT 
    - so far the creation of a component to the Card as "Card.js" was not needed
    - currently, im getting all of the data and desing from the firestore and the MainContent.js page (main page)

// create the search engine or filter engine the items in the main page:
    - for the creation of this was really simple, all i needed to do was to add a const function to filter the items
    - add the input field, and style it accordingly 
    - also add the search engine without the case sensitive thing to filter the cards

    // together with the  search bar, a thick box was added to the right side of it 
        - the thick box is a joined idea
        - same procedure but instead of the input field, the thick box, 
        - using the same fuction 
        - with the finality to when clicked (thicked) only items that are in "LOW STOCK" will apear
        - to ease the ordering procedures of the Company
