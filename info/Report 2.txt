//Choice and connection of the project directly to the database

//Choice of the database

-> Firebase stands to be the best option so far because

	1. Its meant to be a quick development application 
	2. Scalability over a short period of time is not necessary 
	3. Complexity is very low when relating to the serverless database
	4. Easy set-up
Authentication and Hosting:
 because the firebase provides Hosting, it’s a very appealing characteristic for the use of it in the project

 Concluding, the choice of firebase over the mongoDB database is essential for the side of being a project website.
 This means scalability, updates, management as a team, Server hosted and all are not necessary
 Also, from the point of view of complexity and how intuitive firebase is for the development of an website project model.

 - in case the cases above needed to be added or checked, MongoDB would be the best option, but, with mongoDB, an intermediate server would have to be created and used between the code and the database.
