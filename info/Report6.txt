    => for each item when clicken to open the card with a larger size, like zoom in. 
        - make the design in figma 
        - 

    => when the card is opened to open the options to edit the amount,
        - so a button to add(goods in) GREEN, one to reduce (sold, wasted) reduce
        - A button on the top to delete the item from the database. 
        - one button to add the item to a category. 
    
    => create the category page.
        - different cards, design similar to main page
        - multiple cards to express that thats a category.
    
    => display the category (ALL) in the main page 
        - display other categories when clicked in the category link. 
        - categories to be organized like folders
