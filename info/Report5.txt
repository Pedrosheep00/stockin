//Organizing overlays 
- organizing css components of header and MainContent pages, 
- design of the overlay for the hamburguer icon, from the header
- bring the overlay to slide right from the left when clicked

- brin the add-item button to the top of the page 
- organize the css of the page and overlay configuration in the js, so when the add-item button is clicked to open another overlay to input the items 
- creating functions and consts to close the overlay when its being shown and a listener for when click outside the overlay to close it.

//separating collections and auth pages:
- to pull the correct items (products) for each user logged in, 
- connecting the firestore from firebase to the Main Content page according to the auth, so itll know which user is logged in 
- fetch data function added to the bottom of addCardFunction from when the card is added, and saved in the firestore.

// different user will now not be able to see the data from another user. they will be private 

//----------- FOR THE NEXT STEPS --------------------------

- organize the home page to show ALL ITEMS.
- when clicked in the page categories, for each category to only show its correspondent items.
- allow user to input, create new categories, and identify the products for each product.
