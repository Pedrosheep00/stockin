//Create a button to remove the item in the Edit items. in Main Content page 
    - the simple step to create a delete button was just to add the deleteDoc imported from firebase features
    - then add a Handle Const to handle the action 
    - and adding the button to the delete form inside the return statement.
    - then style and reorganize the cards
        - lil issue was encountered when added the buttons, so they wouldnt align in a row, but in a column instead. 
        - fixed this issue by adding both buttons inside a div (box) and styling the box with margin and padding, and positions

//Adding colour code to the minimum amount and mid amount 
    - yellow when the quantity is equals to minimum amount with a range of more or less 1 
    - red when the quantity is less than the minimum amount - 1
    - if the quantity is more than 2 than the minimum amount the colours keeps green. 
        to do this process was pretty easy, all i got to do was add an if else statement (condition)
        to the class of the card, so the class would be added according to the ammount 
        then the class was styles in the Css component.

// FINDING OUT THAT MAYBE, INSTEAD OF CREATING A MAIN PAGE WITH ALL OF THE CARDS, AND PULLING IT ALL FROM THEM, MAYBE
// I SHOULD'VE CREATED A CARD COMPONENT TO FETCH THE CARD DESIGN AND INFORMATION FROM IT 


// TO ADD NEXT

    - add AddItem button to the CategoryItemsPage
