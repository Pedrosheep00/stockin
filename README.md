Here is a Mock user, created to populate some information for better avaliation of the software and its usage without much trouble:

Notes:
-this code was developed By Pedro Nascimento with the help of teatchers from the Dorset College and the use of tools like:
-github
-figma
-OpenAi
-Coolors
-youtube videos
- and others for (font, css)

each and every unit of the software was thought and planned

The use of AI (Chat GPT):
    Open Ai was for sure of great help during the development of this product
    - generating specific functions, 
    - helping and giving guidlines to reorganize each component of the code.
    - re-styling CSS pages and adding new css.
    - troubleshooting and debugging#

    For the fact that most pages, components, and functions where pasted and copied several times from the Ai, in order to troubleshoot or develop, it is possible that comment lines or Ai generated code remains within the project for its functionalities and help to manage.

//About Us page:
    when developing the About us page, Pedro wrote the text representing the story of how the software became from an idea to a project. And what is the goal of the software withing the business world.
    Before uploading the text to the About.js component, He sent it to the Ai and copied the result modifying some bits.

    The story IS original, but with the Ai modifications the text looks more professional and appealing to the user.
