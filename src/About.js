            <h1>About Stokin</h1>

                <p>
                Stokin emerged from the observation of a widespread issue among small businesses and startups, particularly noted throughout 2019 and 2020. Many such enterprises, including pubs, fishmongers, and various retail outlets, struggled with inventory management. Their processes for tracking stock movements—goods in and goods out—were often rudimentary, relying heavily on manual entries and paper lists. This inefficiency highlighted a gap in the market for an automated solution tailored to the unique needs of small-scale operations.

                <p>
                The inception of Stokin was driven by the goal to streamline inventory management for these businesses, enabling them to transition from traditional methods to a more efficient, automated system. The software is designed to automate the tracking of stocks, profits, and orders, thereby eliminating the need for paper-based lists and manual data analysis. It focuses on the practical aspects of inventory control, such as real-time updates on stock levels, supplier information for each product, and a user-friendly dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of product movements within the business. The interface employs color coding to easily signal low and mid-level stock, making it straightforward for users to monitor their inventory status at a glance.

                Developed over four years with a foundation in both programming and business knowledge, Stokin aims to fill the gap left by existing software solutions. While some platforms focus on financial management and others on inventory with premium features, Stokin's uniqueness lies in its commitment to being a comprehensive, free tool for inventory and stock control, especially designed for businesses with limited resources.
